    <em>Hi everyone! In this project I will try to build the HACK computer from <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">Nand2Tetris</a> and run it on real hardware</em>
</p>

---

> **Heads up:** This project is still a work in progress.

---

### What is this?

- **Goal:** Get the HACK computer running on an actual FPGA board (DE10-Lite).
- **Language:** Verilog HDL
- **How:**  
    - Following the Nand2Tetris design, but adapting things as needed  
    - Mixing hierarchical and behavioral models to make it work well on the FPGA
